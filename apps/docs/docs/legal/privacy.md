# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 14, 2026

VeloKit is a developer tool and does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from its users.

## 1. Information Collection
VeloKit is a local CLI tool. All data entered during the "Forge" process (such as bot tokens, API keys, or database URIs) is stored only on your local machine in the generated `.env` file. We do not have access to this information.

## 2. Telemetry
VeloKit does not currently include any telemetry or tracking scripts.

## 3. Third-Party Services
If you choose to use third-party providers (like Google Gemini, Groq, or OpenAI) in your forged bot, their respective privacy policies apply to the data you send to them via your API keys.

## 4. GitHub Data
As an open-source project hosted on GitHub, GitHub may collect standard usage data as per their [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).
